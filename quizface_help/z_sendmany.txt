z_sendmany "fromaddress" [{"address":... ,"amount":...},...] ( minconf ) ( fee )

Send multiple times. Amounts are decimal numbers with at most 8 digits of precision.
Change generated from one or more transparent addresses flows to a new transparent
address, while change generated from a shielded address returns to itself.
When sending coinbase UTXOs to a shielded address, change is not allowed.
The entire value of the UTXO(s) must be consumed.
Before Sapling activates, the maximum number of zaddr outputs is 54 due to transaction size limits.
